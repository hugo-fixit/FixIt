> [FixIt](https://github.com/hugo-fixit/FixIt) is a **clean**, **elegant** but **advanced** blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It is based on the original [LoveIt Theme](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt), [KeepIt Theme](https://github.com/Fastbyte01/KeepIt) and [LeaveIt Theme](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt).

The FixIt theme inherits the excellent features of these themes, and adds new features and optimizations on those basis. Please read [Why Choose FixIt](#why-choose-fixit) to learn more.

## Getting started

Head to the [getting started page](http://fixit.lruihao.cn/documentation/getting-started/) or start with a template:

* [hugo-fixit/hugo-fixit-blog-git](https://github.com/hugo-fixit/hugo-fixit-blog-git)
* [hugo-fixit/hugo-fixit-blog-go](https://github.com/hugo-fixit/hugo-fixit-blog-go)

## [Documentation](https://fixit.lruihao.cn/categories/documentation/)

Head to this [documentation page](https://fixit.lruihao.cn/documentation/basics/) for a complete guidence to get started with the FixIt theme.

Or run [Documentation Site](https://fixit.lruihao.cn) locally, see more details from [Contributing](#contributing).

In addition, there is the [FixIt wiki](https://github.com/hugo-fixit/FixIt/wiki).

## Migrate from LoveIt

If you are currently using the LoveIt theme (or some other themes), it is very easy to migrate to FixIt.

You can add this repo as a submodule of your site directory. Alternatively, you can install the theme in [other ways](https://fixit.lruihao.cn/documentation/basics/#install-theme).

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/hugo-fixit/FixIt.git themes/FixIt
```

And later you can update the submodule in your site directory to the latest commit using this command:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

Next, go to the `config.toml` and change the default theme to `FixIt`.

```diff
- theme = "LoveIt"
+ theme = "FixIt"
```

Now the migration is finished and everything is ready üéâ

## Why choose FixIt

The FixIt theme inherits the excellent features of themes such as LoveIt, and adds new features and optimizations on those basis, as detailed in [Features](#features). In addition, the FixIt theme has the following advantages:

* Complete Chinese and English official documentations
* Community support: Theme official website, Discussions and official QQ group
* Continuously and actively update
* Constantly incorporate suggestions and ideas from all sides
* Highly open theme customizable section

In short, if you prefer the design language and freedom of the FixIt theme, and if you like to personalize your own themes as I do, the FixIt theme may be more suitable for you.
