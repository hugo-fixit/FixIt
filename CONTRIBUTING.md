# CONTRIBUTING

Make sure that you follow [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) while contributing and engaging in the discussions.

## Prerequisites

Before you start contributing, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** (>= 20.0.0) - Required for package management and build tools
- **Hugo Extended** (>= 0.147.7) - The static site generator
- **pnpm** - Package manager (recommended)

You can check your installed versions:

```bash
node --version
hugo version
pnpm --version
```

## How to contribute to this project

First, fork this repository by clicking the fork button.

Next, clone your forked repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hugo-fixit/FixIt.git && cd FixIt
```

Then, install the dev dependencies.

```bash
pnpm install
```

And now you are ready to go!

Here are some useful commands for development:

### Development

```bash
# Run local server with demo content
pnpm dev

# Run local server with test content
pnpm test

# Run local server with documentation (requires fixit-docs as sibling directory)
pnpm dev:docs
```

> [!TIP]
>
> - You can run `pnpm dev -e production` or `pnpm test -e production` to check the production environment.
> - If you want to work on documentation-related theme changes, the simplest way is to have both `FixIt` and `fixit-docs` cloned as sibling directories.

### Building

```bash
# Build demo site
pnpm build

# Build test site
pnpm build:test

# Build both demo and test sites for deployment (includes public directory reorganization)
pnpm build:vercel
```

### Preview

```bash
# Preview the built site locally (requires build:vercel first)
pnpm preview
```
